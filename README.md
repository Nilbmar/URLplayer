# Dropzone
Create .URL internet shortcuts in the Windows format whether on Linux or Windows

[url-opener-linux script](https://github.com/Nilbmar/url-opener-linux) required for opening the created files on Linux

## Purpose
The Windows operating system has a feature that allows you to save website addresses on your harddrive in the form of .URL files. The file is a text file with a header that says [InternetShortcut] followed by "URL=" and the address. 

Certain video links, such as on Youtube, can save to a particular time in the video. It is possible to open the .URL file and manually change the "URL=" field to the one with the time stamp, but that is an annoyance.

With Dropzone, you can copy the timestamped link from Youtube's right-click menu, then click on the folder icon of one of your Favorites in Dropzone to easily save the corrected link.
